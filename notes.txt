$ brew tap osx-cross/avr
$ brew install avr-gcc
brew install avrdude

https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal
cargo +stable install ravedude

In the end the key steps were:
1. taking a look at avr-hal
2. cloning it and running an example.
3. installing ravedude with teh above command
4. had to kind of pull stuff out of the top level Cargo.toml to do with profiles (without this I got some pretty random build errors)
5. also had to kind of rebuild the cargo.toml that was in the arduino-uno examples folder
6. needed to put in a rust-toolchain.toml to force the toolchain to a certain version (there is some bug I believe)
7. needed to clone the avr-atmega328p.json for the avr-hal repo and create a .cargo/config.toml, that looked like the one in the examples folder
8. bit of googling required to fix the rust-analyzer but followed some leads on this https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/3801
in the end it was just about telling rust-analyzer what the target was.
